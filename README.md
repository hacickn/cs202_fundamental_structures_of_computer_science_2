# cs202_fundamental_structures_of_computer_science_2
It consists of the codes that I wrote in cs202 class in Bilkent University which is Data structures and algorithms with c++ 2. There are 4 homeworks and their grades are higher than 85 out of 100. Description files and codes can be found in each file.

- 1. Implementing sorting algorithms and analysis of results.
- 2. Binary Node and Binary Search Tree implementation and visualisation.
- 3. Implementing Priority queue with using heap and with this data structure we implemented a printer simulation.
- 4. Impelenting graphs, hashtable and with using them, calculation of shortest path, all vertices etc.
